# AirBnB_clone

this is the airbnb project of Doye Solomon and Nelson Alexander

The console is the first segment of the AirBnB project at ALX that will collectively cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming through python

The goal of AirBnB project is to eventually deploy our server a simple copy of the AirBnB Website

A command interpreter is created in this segment to manage objects for the AirBnB site

### Functionalities of this command interpreter:

*  Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)

|  Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc..

*  Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
